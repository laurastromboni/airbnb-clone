I've been hosting since 2011 and was recently named a SuperHost. Getting to meet new guests everyday -- and the trust inherent in that process -- brings me a lot of joy. While I'm originally from the east coast, I moved to San Francisco 22 years ago and it's my home now.  San Francisco is heaven on earth -- a magical place with a collective spirit of diversity, creativity, and open-mindedness.\r\n\r\nI'm currently getting a PhD in sociology at UC Davis. My recent research has focused on elites and education, and currently I'm researching women in high tech. I'm also a freelance photographer for a textbook called Seeing Sociology and I write as freelancer as well. \r\n\r\nI love movies, mostly independent films and documentaries. My favorite films are The Station Agent, American Beauty, and, most recently, Boyhood. My favorite documentary is Baraka. \r\n\r\nTravel is pretty much in my blood. I sometimes just have to get away to spark creativity. I have driven across country twice. I've been to Cuba, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia and, most recently, Japan. I love meeting new people and enjoy hearing about people's lives. So I hope we will have a chance to talk while you're here!\r\n\r\nI love good food too. I do some cooking, but I'm better at knowing where to get good food in the city. \r\n\r\nI'm a big music fan as well - in fact I have a guitar here you are welcome to play if you know how since I sure haven't been using it lately. I am also up on the best venues to see music in the city if you're interested in that.\r\n\r\nIn terms of my style as a host, I tend to be pretty attuned to my guests' needs. I can usually sense if they need my help with things, in which case I am always happy to provide any guidance. I like to give guests plenty of space to have their own experience here, so you won't find me being overbearing and asking for your time. I'm pretty quiet and spend a lot of time in my room reading or working. But I do love to have chats with the guests to find out where they've been that day and how they liked it, and particularly if they tried any of the recs I provided. \r\n\r\nThe bottom line is I love to have guests in my home.
