We have a little community of artists, musicians, healers, construction workers - all enjoying the wonderful nature and shared living here.",

He bikes, runs, swims, sometimes all in the same day. Together, Kitty and Michael teach Meditation classes with the \"Teaching of Intuitional Metaphysics\" under the guidance of the Masters Babaji, Jesus, and St. Germain.\r\n\r\nThe young adults here are photographers, surfers, artists and/or musicians and budding farmers.\r\nWe are slowly turning this land into a permaculture farm and a center of creativity, learning to live simply, with joy and kindness.\r\n \r\nWe hold a public non-denominational meditation at our house every Sunday night: you are welcome to join us if you are here.\r\n\r\nWe have been hosting on airbnb since July, 2009 and really love what this company has made possible. We have met so many wonderful people from around the world that we would never have met if we hadn't had this opportunity with airbnb! Some of our guests (especially the ones from Europe) have never seen a hummingbird before and here they get to see them up close - just a few feet from them as the birds \"hum\" around the feeders.\r\n\r\nWe welcome you to come experience the peace and tranquility that our wonderful land has to offer.",
